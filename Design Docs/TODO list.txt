Current TODO Stack:
	Win condition: Route
	
		

BUGS:
	Can't remove units from selectedEnemyRange
	Ally move range doesn't look good enough
	Upleft into an enemy unit, the straight up (all within areas you could normally reach) causes the movement arrow to go straight through the enemy unit. (Fix diagonals)
	When determining which enemies are in range, the game only checks the equipped weapon.
	Resize isn't working again.

	
Fixed Bugs:
	60fps? -- major Jittery map movement: 1000/60 was an int,
	Camera movement could use a better algorithm -- Camera movement now has a speed limit. All else was fine.
	Pressing L while the cursor is on a unit, the L input doesn't care. Which can lead to an L press going nowhere. Set last unit to hovered unit
	cursor doesn't bump anymore (delay after first move, which allows for more precise movement)
	movementArrow Diagonals don't quite work (remove diagonals)
	During moveMode, pressing A outside the move range shouldn't do anything.
	Pressing B from 6 runs the same frame of UnitActionBox again
	Pressing up and right in quick succession does not queue up a right command unless another up command was pressed. -- Pressing buttons in quick succession should now queue up commands

	
Discarded Bugs:
	(?) Reweight can crash if it goes out of bounds, but it never should. If this actually ever happens, create a reset button for mapscene.
	Pathfinding really shouldn't need to see mapscene. Maybe move the unit list into map?
	resizing has weird effects sometimes. This may not matter, as you should never be able to resize ingame anyway.


Maybe Someday:
	Unit speed on button press
	Escape exits dialogue quickly.
	Escape opens up a "Do you want to quit" menu on mapscene
