How should AI work?
pa
Simple AI: 
	Enemies are off by default.
	Turned on when something enters their attack radius. Or on a turn trigger.
	Once on, they find all enemies in their move+attack range
		If none, they move to the nearest enemy
		If some, they atta	ck the target they have highest EDPS on. (might - [def or res] * 2 if speed). Maybe might work out their EDPS vs their target's EDPS.
	Enemies move in order of "Don't have to move to hit something", "Can move and hit" and "Can't target an enemy" to reduce the ammount of accidental crowding out.
	If a destination is occupied, it moves as far along its movement path as it can.

	How it decides where to move:
		Unit checks its min and max range. Makes a list of all points around enemies within that range. Removes duplicates, occupied and immpassable loctations.
		Generates a pathfinding map, and looks at each of these locations, it chooses the closest one. Or the first on the list, in case of tie.

Fake Test AI:
	Moves 1 tile right and attacks a random target if able.

So: we have a function that goes through all the attackable locations. It orders them by closest to farthest.

When we get back to AI, AI should check if the closest one is occupied, if it is try the next one etc, until we're past how far the unit can move. 
If no point was reachable this turn, it moves towards the first point as much as it can

UUUUUUUUUUUUGH:

	Figure out how to actually move the dumb thing
	Create a list that only has the locations you can actually attack stuff from.
	rename pathfinding funtions things like "threatRange"
	
	
Current thought stack	
	Developing AI
		Get list of enemy units
		Find unoccupied attackable points in walking distance
		if exist
			Confirm move location and action taken.
				STOP MOVING TO LOCATIONS YOU ALREADY OCCUPY
		else
			move towards closest enemy unit on the map
			if no enemies can be reached by any means, move as far as possible literally towards the team's boss
				if the team doesn't have a boss, do nothing.
				if the team has more than one boss, the true boss is the one whatever I figure out finds first.
