How should AI work?
pa
Simple AI: 
	Enemies are off by default.
	Turned on when something enters their attack radius. Or on a turn trigger.
	Once on, they find all enemies in their move+attack range
		If none, they move to the nearest enemy
		If some, they attack the target they have highest estimated net damage on.
	Enemies move in order of "Don't have to move to hit something", "Can move and hit" and "Can't target an enemy" to reduce the ammount of accidental crowding out.
		For now, they just move in the order they were made, but it's nice to dream.
	If a destination is occupied, it moves as far along its movement path as it can.

	How it decides where to move:
		Unit checks its min and max range. Makes a list of all points around enemies within that range. Removes duplicates, occupied and immpassable loctations.
		Generates a pathfinding map, and looks at each of these locations, it chooses the closest one. Or the first on the list, in case of tie.

So: we have a function that goes through all the attackable locations. It orders them by closest to farthest.

When we get back to AI, AI should check if the closest one is occupied, if it is try the next one etc, until we're past how far the unit can move. 
If no point was reachable this turn, it moves towards the first point as much as it can
